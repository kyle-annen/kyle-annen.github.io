# End of a Long Road, Base of the Mountain
After years of self directed learning, and some aimless wandering, I am pleased to start the next steps of my programming journey with [8th Light][8thlight] as a Resident Apprentice.  It took roughly 4,000 hours of independent programming, and hopefully some can benefit from my experience. 

After so much meandering I am pleased to have mentors to guide me on my journey, and it is a mountain I'll climb for the rest of my life.

While there is no one path, I will share my thoughts on how I would have proceeded knowing what I know now.

# Start with Javascript 
*Dev-bootcamps, online-bootcamps, programming courses, open courseware, interactive online programming platforms, books from the bookstore, coding clubs, and Meetups.* 

The resources available to new programmers is truly endless, as there is no possible way to read and complete them all before more are generated. It was such an information overload that it took me about a year to even have a semblance of a path.  

Today I can say with confidence that Javascript is an excellent and efficient place to start. Every interactive webpages needs, at a minimum, Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

In the current climate I would highly suggest starting with Javascript. 

Javascript is the de-facto choice for front-end scripting. There are other languages that can be used, though all currently are compiled to Javascript prior to execution(Elm, TypeScript, CoffeeScript).


Javascript is now more popular than ever. In 2008 Chrome web browser shipped with a new Javascript engine, Chrome V8. It massively increased the efficiency of Javascript in the browser.  

Since V8 is open source, it has lead to the rise of the server-side Javascript run-time NodeJS. 

With Javascript popularity booming, starting your journey with JS is a no-brainer.

# Use a Guided Progression (FreeCodeCamp) 

![Free Code Camp]({{ site.url }}/assets/freeCodeCampBanner.png)

[FreeCodeCamp][freecodecamp] is an online free interactive web platform with a thriving community. FreeCodeCamp was built specifically to address the circuitous way the founder learned to code.

The estimated time for completion is roughly 2000 hours.  

The self paced yet highly structured nature and immediate visual feedback makes the platform incredibly addicting. The recent focus shift to highly marketable languages and frameworks makes it a solid bet.  Through the program you will learn Javascript, CSS, HTML, NodeJS, Express, React and D3.js.

Prior to starting FreeCodeCamp I had completed [The Odin Project][theodinproject], an online curriculum created by self-taught programmers and maintained by those that have completed the curriculum. It is open source, and can be edited by anyone.  It is an extremely good resource, and is focused on Ruby on Rails.  While was an invaluable resource in my learning, it begins with Ruby on Rails and builds up from the back end. 

FreeCodeCamp is so good because the first exercises are building a cat website for mobile, and you can instantly see the product.  I believe that more people can stick with learning if they can see something they have made themselves quickly.  That is why I suggest FreeCodeCamp.

# The Great Wide Unknown

After completing, or in my case, mostly completing FreeCodeCamp, you will have all the tools necessary to learn any programming language:

* Ability to learn independently.
* An understanding of programming.
* Knowing where to start.
* Knowing where to go when you are stuck.
* Grit and perseverance.
