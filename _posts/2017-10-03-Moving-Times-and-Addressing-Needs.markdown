At 8th light apprentices meet four times a week for a talk given by one of the Crafters, our graduated apprentices. Everyone in 8th Light goes through an apprenticeship which last from 3 to 9 months depending on prior experience.  The talks focus on a wide range of topics from programming specific to math and beyond.

# Mined minds

This week we meet with an group doing some very important and honorable work.  Mined Minds works to relieve the vast economic hardships of the closing coal mines in the appalachians.

The closing mines have left rifts through small town USA leaving despair and a vast lack of employment opportunities. Their mission is to teach programming to displaced coal miners, to mine the minds left in wake of a changing world.

You can read more about Mined Mines and their incredibly noble pursuits [here][minedmines].

This type of economic hardship in small towns has occurred in other areas of the USA at different times in history.

# NAFTA and the logging industries

On January 1st, 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement came into full effect. The lumber industries in the Rocky Mountains where hit particularly hard as US lumber companies were unable to compete with the subsidized lumber flowing in from Canada.  Lumber mills, which were the life blood of many small towns throughout rural Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana were left without a source of employment.

Luckily many of the affected ex loggers and millwrights were provided with some means to seek higher education, and many sought out Teaching and Health Care certifications. Gruff, hard men changed and molded themselves into some of the best teachers, nurses and mental-health workers in the area. It was not an easy road but they were left with little options.

# Intelligence, the bad word

The dictionary definition of intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skill. This definition while accurate in the academic sense does accurately capture the perceptions of the world for those educated in recent American history. For those in their 30s and beyond, intelligence is the innate ability to rapidly understand and apply knowledge at a rate faster than the norm.

In order to teach those that are not used to failure, we have to redefine the word intelligence. Better yet, we should eliminate the correlation of intelligence and ability to gain new skills outside of ones comfort zone. The use of the words persistence and hard-word is more in sync with the life experiences of the men and women who spent their working lives dodging trees and sweating deep under the ground.  These are words they identify with, and hold deep pride in.

I have known these type of men through my entire childhood.  Hard, gruff, tireless and working to put food on the table. The drive to put one foot in front of the other on the edge of exhaustion because it is the norm. All with stories of seemingly superhuman levels of effort was the norm.

# Breaking the cycle of gate keeping

The world is changing, in a way in which we have not seen since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. It was difficult for those displaced by the industrial revolution to see what the future would hold for former laborers. Similarly it is hard to see how we fit in a changing world.  Our's is an industry that has seen an influx of non-traditional programmers over the past ten years. The language we use to introduce outsiders into our professional can have a profound impact.  It is clear that genius or a highly technical mind is not needed in order to succeed in the tech industry, and it is also clear that there are those that still believe that only a certain type of person is fit to wear the mantel of a software developer.

The news has been inundated with stories centered around the fears of industry veterans in the face of a changing workforce who lash out in fear. This fear is misplaced.  Change is scary, however if we focus on how we can all learn from each other instead of worrying over our differences, and seek to shift to language of inclusion over exclusion, we can lower the gates to all our benefit.

Knowledge was guarded for most of human history. Libraries reserved for an elite few. Technology horded. Active subjugation through the withholding of power. Knowledge used to control.

By freeing this knowledge we become better than we could alone. This is more evident than ever as the world relies more and more on open source software, the releasing of patents for batteries and electric motors to the public space, and by bring worlds together through tutelage and the open exchange ideas.
