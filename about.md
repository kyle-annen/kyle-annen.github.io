Raised on a farm in the Idaho wilderness, I have worked in the slums of Mexico, the bustling streets of Hong Kong and the chaotic yet wonderful Shanghai. I set a 10 year record at The University of Notre Dame in the Hammer Throw, and taught High School in rural Idaho and inner-city Chicago.

I taught myself to program well enough to gain an apprenticeship at [8th Light][8th-light], the creator of the modern software apprenticeship.

My free time is spent loving the outdoors, biking in the city, and sampling all that Chicago has to offer. I also coach and compete for USATF Track & Field.
